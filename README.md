# Class 12 Computer Project for CBSE C++

C++ programs that I was assigned for CBSE for the session 2019-20. Both, the first and second term projects can be found over here. 
I have used the `GNU C/C++ Compiler`. Instructions to run the programs for `Borland Compilers` and Environments like `TurboC++` are documented.
I have used header files in my project but you should consult your teacher about the acceptability of such a method. Try submitting your
programs as stand-alone versions. 


## List of Programs you can find here:
* A program on _`Classes and Objects`_
* 5 programs based on demonstrating _`Inheritance`_
* 4 Programs based on _`arrays (both 1D and 2D)`_
* _`Stack using arrays`_
* _`Stack using LinkedLists`_
* _`Queue using array`_
* Searching Algorithms: _`Binary Search`_ and _`Linear Search`_
* Sorting Algorithms: _`Bubble Sort`_, _`Selection Sort`_ and _`Insertion Sort`_
*There's more to come. I'll be pushing the second term board exam programs too!*


## TODO
- [x] Adding the programs
- [ ] Pushing the `bin` folder with working binaries for both, windows and linux environments which can be used for easy screenshotting and pasting in projects.
- [ ] Providing a well-written documentation
