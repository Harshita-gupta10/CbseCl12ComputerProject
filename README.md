# Class 12 Computer Project for CBSE C++

C++ programs that I was assigned for CBSE for the session 2019-20. Both, the first and second term projects can be found over here. 
I have used the `GNU C/C++ Compiler`. Instructions to run the programs for `Borland Compilers` and Environments like `TurboC++` are documented.
I have used header files in my project but you should consult your teacher about the acceptability of such a method. Try submitting your
programs as stand-alone versions. 

## TODO
* Pushing the `bin` folder with working binaries for both, windows and linux environments which can be used for easy screenshotting and 
  pasting in projects.
* Providing a well-written documentation
